SIGSTOP is a signal sent programmatically (eg: kill -STOP pid ) while 
SIGTSTP is sent by a user typing on a keyboard, usually Control-Z.

SIGSTOP cannot be ignored. SIGTSTP might be.


1. Sending a Signal : 1) kernal detects an error or the child process is terminated;
                      2) the process explicitly send a signal by calling kill() function;

2. receiving a Signal: The process can either ignore the signal, terminate, or 
                    catch the signal by executing a user-level function called a signal handler.

3. SIGSTP -- stop all the processes in the foreground job;
   SIGINT -- terminate all the processes in the background job;





pid_t getpgrp(void) -- return the group process id of the calling process.
int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t gpid) -- setpgid(0,0)
